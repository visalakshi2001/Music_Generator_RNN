    st.write("Generating music has a few notable differences from generating images and videos. \
    First, music is an art of time, necessitating a temporal model. Second, music is usually composed \
    of multiple instruments/tracks with their own temporal dynamics, but collectively they unfold \
    over time interdependently. Lastly, musical notes are often grouped into chords, arpeggios, \
    or melodies in polyphonic music, and thereby introducing a chronological ordering of notes \
    is not naturally suitable. In recent years, there has been efforts to generate art styles like \
    text production, video production and consequently music production. This involves starting with \
    producing music from single notes, multi-note chorus music from concerts, etc. In this project, \
    we focus upon producing monophonic music from a single instrument (majorly classical piano tunes) \
    and aim to achieve a seamless synthetic generation of music with recurrent neaural network.")
